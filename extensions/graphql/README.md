# @loopback/graphql

This module provides integration with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) using
[type-graphql](https://typegraphql.com/).

## Stability: ⚠️Experimental⚠️

> Experimental packages provide early access to advanced or experimental
> functionality to get community feedback. Such modules are published to npm
> using `0.x.y` versions. Their APIs and functionality may be subject to
> breaking changes in future releases.

## Basic Use

```ts
export class MyApplication extends BootMixin(RestApplication) {
  constructor(config: ApplicationConfig) {
    super(config);
    this.projectRoot = __dirname;
    this.component(GraphQLComponent);
    this.configure(GraphQLBindings.GRAPHQL_SERVER).to({asMiddlewareOnly: true});
  }
}
```

## Configure GraphQLServer

This package can be used in two flavors:

- As a server for LoopBack applications
- As a middleware for LoopBack REST applications

## Use LoopBack dependency injections in resolver classes

All of LoopBack decorators for dependency injection , such as `@inject`,
`@service`, `repository`, and `config`, can be used with resolver classes.

```ts
import {service} from '@loopback/core';
@resolver(of => Recipe)
export class RecipeResolver implements ResolverInterface<Recipe> {
  constructor(
    // constructor injection of service using LoopBack
    @service()
    private readonly recipeService: RecipeService,
  ) {}
}
```

## Boot GraphQL resolvers

The `GraphQLComponent` contributes a booter that discovers and registers
resolver classes from `src/graphql-resolvers` during `app.boot()`.

- recipe-resolver.ts

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @loopback/graphql
```

## Try it out

```sh
npm run build
node dist/__tests__/fixtures/graphql-test/src/index.js
```

You should see the following messages:

```sh
Server is running at http://[::1]:3000
Try http://[::1]:3000/graphql
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000/graphql in your browser to play with the GraphiQL.

1. Copy the query to the right panel:

```graphql
query GetRecipe1 {
  recipe(recipeId: "1") {
    title
    description
    ratings
    creationDate
    ratingsCount(minRate: 2)
    averageRating
    ingredients
    numberInCollection
  }
}
```

2. Click on the run icon:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "recipe": {
      "title": "Recipe 1",
      "description": "Desc 1",
      "ratings": [0, 3, 1],
      "creationDate": "2018-04-11T00:00:00.000Z",
      "ratingsCount": 1,
      "averageRating": 1.3333333333333333,
      "ingredients": ["one", "two", "three"],
      "numberInCollection": 1
    }
  }
}
```
